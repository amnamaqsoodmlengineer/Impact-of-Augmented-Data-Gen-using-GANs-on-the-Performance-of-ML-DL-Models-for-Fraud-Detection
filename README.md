## Introduction

Insurance fraud poses a significant threat to the insurance industry, causing substantial financial losses and eroding customer trust. Early detection of fraudulent claims is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the insurance business and promoting customer confidence.

This study aims to investigate the performance of machine learning and deep learning models trained on both original and synthetic datasets generated using GANs. Our primary objectives are:

- To evaluate the performance of traditional ML and advanced DL models in detecting insurance fraud
- To determine whether synthetic data can enhance the performance of these models
- To explore the potential benefits of GAN-augmented data in addressing the challenge of small, imbalanced datasets in insurance fraud detection

## Methods

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

GANs are a type of deep learning model consisting of two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator. These networks compete against each other to create synthetic data that mimics the distribution of real data. In this project, GANs were employed to generate synthetic samples for augmenting our insurance fraud dataset.

Key aspects of our GAN implementation:

- Architecture: We utilized a state-of-the-art GAN architecture optimized for generating realistic synthetic data
- Training: The GAN was trained on a subset of the original dataset to capture the underlying patterns and distributions
- Evaluation: Generated samples were evaluated for realism and diversity to ensure they resembled genuine data

### Model Evaluation

Three primary models were evaluated in this study:

#### Logistic Regression (LR)

Logistic Regression is a statistical model commonly used for binary classification problems. It is particularly suitable for linearly separable datasets and provides interpretable results.

#### Random Forest (RF)

Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to produce more accurate predictions. It is effective in handling non-linear relationships and large datasets.

#### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

CNNs are widely used for image and pattern recognition tasks. In this project, CNNs were applied to detect anomalies in structured insurance data.

Each model was trained and evaluated on both the original dataset and the synthetic dataset generated by GANs.

## Discussion

The results demonstrate a significant improvement in model performance after training on GAN-generated synthetic data. Across all three models, we observed substantial enhancements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. This suggests that augmenting the dataset with synthetic samples generated by GANs can substantially enhance fraud detection capabilities.

Key insights:

1. **Performance Boost**: The consistent improvement across all models indicates that GAN-augmented data is beneficial for fraud detection tasks.

2. **Handling Small Datasets**: GANs prove particularly effective when dealing with small datasets, providing a way to augment data and improve model generalization.

3. **Financial Impact**: The adoption of GANs for data augmentation can be highly beneficial for the insurance industry in terms of cost savings through improved fraud detection and reduced fraudulent claims.

## Conclusion

This study demonstrates the potential of GAN-augmented data in enhancing insurance fraud detection capabilities. The significant performance improvements observed across Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and CNN models trained on synthetic data highlight the value of GAN-generated samples in addressing the challenges posed by small, imbalanced datasets in fraud detection.

The findings of this research open up new possibilities for the insurance industry, potentially leading to more effective fraud detection systems, improved financial stability, and increased trust among customers. As machine learning and deep learning technologies continue to evolve, we anticipate further advancements in the application of GANs and other AI techniques for insurance fraud prevention.
